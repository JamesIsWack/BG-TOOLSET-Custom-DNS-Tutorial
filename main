<h1>How to set up BG TOOLSET DNS for Playstation 3</h1>

<p style="font-size:14px; color:#000000; font-weight:; font-style:italic;"></p>
    This is gonna be pretty simple and I probably dont need a GitHub Pages for it, but i wanted to so...</p>
<p>Anyway. First thing you need is the DNS itself</p>
<p>First, set your Primary DNS to 142.132.167.254, and the Secondary as 0.0.0.0, or your prefered DNS provider. This should work on CFW and HFW, as well as OFW since your jailbreaking.</p>
<p style="font-size:14px; color:#00d9ff; font-weight:; font-style:italic;">
   This DNS service is provided by
    <span style="color: #ff0000">kostirez on Discord,</span>
    consider
    <span style="color: #0000a0">donating to him.</span> 
    All proceeds go to PS3XPLOIT Team and BG after the site is back online!
  </p>
<p>The DNS can be set in Network Settings, and you NEED to select Custom before setting it. When its at the DNS part, select Custom and imput the DNS's I provided. Once you have gone thru the steps, and done a network test, you need to access BG TOOLSET directly. Go into the PS3 browser and press Start. Imput "http://ps3xploit.net/bgtoolset" without the qoutes, and press Start again. BG TOOLSET should show up. If you have any issues contact me on Discord: JamesIsWack#8330</p>
